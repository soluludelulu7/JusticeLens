## Core Features:

- Data Extraction: Analyze uploaded court records using NLP to extract defendant demographics, charges, sentence lengths, and outcomes.
- Bias Detection: Compare sentencing patterns across different demographic groups using statistical tests and flag potential disparities.
- Visual Dashboards: Display identified disparities using simple charts, heatmaps, and trend lines. Calculate and display an overall bias score.
